1.5 (updated July 19, 2011 by Marc Miller, marc@bigoceanstudios.com)

	The purpose of most of these changes was to beef up the Weblogs page to show me as much information as possible. I've found these additions really helpful in providing me with better information as I prepare a site to upgrade from EE1 to EE2. These things are also really useful when dealing with a MSM site.

	Made MSM compatible
		-moved stylesheets and scripts to themes directory for MSM compatibility.
		-if MSM is installed, display current Site ID in the Side Navigation

	Added Side Navigation links/items
		-to Modules
		-to Extenstions
		-to Plugins
		-to Field Groups page
		-if FieldFrame is installed, to FieldFrame settings
		-if Wygwam is installed, to Wygwam config page

		-on Weblogs Page - added a box of all the Custom Field types that are in use (to check if there is a rogue Field type that won't be EE2 compatible)
		  - there does appear to be a slight bug in this feature. If you create a Matrix Custom Field and then delete it, the Matrix columns do not get deleted out of the Matrix table. So those orphan Matrix field types will show up here.

	Weblogs Page enhancements
		Main Header - added a link to view all the entries in that weblog
		Sub Header	- added jquery collapsible items to the Categories and Status groups
								- added the default field group name (and link) that is assigned to that weblog
		Footer			- added 2 textareas with an auto-created MySql query (hidden by default) for that weblog. Useful when you need to alter all the entries in that weblog in PHPMyAdmin.
		Weblog Body	-	added Searchable? column
								-	added Field Group column - useful to determine where the Gypsy fields are located separate from the assigned Field Group
								- if the Type is Wygwam, the Wygwam Config name will display with link to config page
								- added Directory/Matrix cols column
										- displays and links to File Upload Directory for:
												-MH File
												-NGen File Field
												-MX Universal Editor
												-Wygwam
										- if Matrix is installed, displays each of the columns (with column ID) in that Matrix table
												- also displays upload directory if Wygwam, MX Universal Editor, or NGen file in Matrix column
